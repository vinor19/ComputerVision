    "# DM890 Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this semester, we will use Google Colab for the assignments, which allows us to utilize resources that some of us might not have in their local machines such as GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Google Colab Tutorial\n",
    "---\n",
    "Go to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/, you will see a tutorial named \"Welcome to Colaboratory\" file, where you can learn the basics of using google colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Settings used for assignments: ***Edit -> Notebook Settings -> Runtime Type (Python 3)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "---\n",
    "This project is an introduction to deep learning tools for computer vision. You will design and train deep convolutional networks for scene recognition using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). You can visualize the\n",
    "structure of the network with [mNeuron] (http://vision03.csail.mit.edu/cnn_art/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous you have trained a deep convolutional network from scratch to recognize scenes. The starter codes similar to the previous assignment gives you methods to load data and display them. In the previous assignment you might have managed to achieve a recognition accuracy to 50, 60, or perhaps 70%. Unfortunately, we only have 2,400 training examples so it doesn't seem possible to train a network from scratch which outperforms hand-crafted features\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this assignment, you will instead fine-tune a pre-trained deep network to achieve about 85% accuracy on the task. We will use the pretrained AlexNet network which was not trained to recognize scenes at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach and the previous approach of training from the scratch represent the most common approaches to recognition problems in computer vision today -- train a deep network from scratch if you have enough data (it's not always obvious whether or not you do), and if you cannot then instead fine-tune a pre-trained network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 sub problems (under Problem 1) in this homework with a total of 70 points and 10 bonus points. Be sure to read **Submission Guidelines** below. They are important. For the problems requiring text descriptions, you might want to add a markdown block for that. **Note that the instructor and the TAs are not going to provide any further information regarding the bonus question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "---\n",
    "Save the [dataset(click me)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NWC3TMsXSWN2TeoYMCjhf2N1b-WRDh-M) into your working folder in your Google Drive for this homework. <br> This can also be possible using symbolic links or shortcuts as they are called in Google Drive. Using this trick you do not need to load the dataset into your own drive.\n",
    "Under your root folder, there should be a folder named \"data\" (i.e. XXX/SDU-ID/data) containing the images.\n",
    "**Do not upload** the data subfolder before submitting on blackboard due to size limit. There should be only one .ipynb file under your root folder Surname_Givenname_sdu-handle.\n",

    "**Strategy A**: *Fine-tune* an existing network. In this scenario you take an existing network, replace the final layer (or more) with random weights, and train the entire network again with images and ground truth labels for your recognition task. You are effectively treating the pre-trained deep network as a better initialization than the random weights used when training from scratch. When you don't have enough training data to train a complex network from scratch (e.g. with the 16 classes) this is an attractive option. Fine-tuning can work far better than Strategy B of taking the activations directly from an pre-trained CNN. For example, in [this paper](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/papers/deep_geo.pdf) from CVPR 2015, there wasn't enough data to train a deep network from scratch, but fine tuning led to 4 times higher accuracy than using off-the-shelf networks directly.\n",

You would train a classifier (typically a linear SVM) in that 1000 dimensional feature space. However, those activations are clearly very object specific and may not generalize well to new recognition tasks. It is generally better to use the activations in slightly earlier layers of the network, e.g. the 4096 activations in the last 2nd fully-connected layer. You can often get away with sub-sampling those 4096 activations considerably, e.g. taking only the first 1000 activations.\n",
